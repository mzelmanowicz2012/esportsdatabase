Applied Database Systems Project


As of creation of this repository:

e_sports.sql is the MySQL file that contains the current database tables & data - can by imported into a phpmyadmin, etc. for easy use either on an actual server or on a localhost that has phpmyadmin integrated such as XAMPP.

The rest of the pages are included as php/html/js files. There is currently no CSS.

The website currently only features account registration, login, and logout. Everything currently implemented should be working correctly. Logging in and logging out works and it saves your session properly using cookies. Pages such as the index display differently based on whether you are logged in or not.
Navigating the actual database as a user is not implemented yet, will come next and should be rather simple in comparison to the work done so far.

Two test accounts, myname (pass: mypass) and alice (pass: alice) presently exist as users, can use them as login tests if you don't feel like creating more users.
