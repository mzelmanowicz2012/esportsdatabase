Current status:

e_sports.sql is the MySQL file that contains the current database tables & data - can by imported into a phpmyadmin, etc. for easy use either on an actual server or on a localhost that has phpmyadmin integrated such as XAMPP.

The rest of the pages are included as php/html/js/css/etc. files. 

Account registration, login, and logout, are implemented. Logging in and logging out works and it saves your session properly using cookies. Pages such as the index display differently based on whether you are logged in or not.
Several database pages exist. They feature a standard view as well as for many of them a single search option.
Most pages should just be simple variations of each other.

Present test accounts:
myname (pass: mypass) (spectator account)
alice (pass: alice) (spectator account)
company (pass:company) (company account)

Use them as login tests if you don't feel like creating more users.
